Multi-purpose lexicons for two-level morphological analysis, entry conversion and entry guessing

This repository contains scripts and examples for maintaining lexicons for word and affix entries.  Common CSV formats are used for lexical data so that short and simple Python3 scripts can convert the data into LEXC lexicons for morphological analysis.
